ğŸ‘‹ Greetings Earthlings. I'm known as @Haronniin pretty much everywhere on the interwebs. (The name was taken from C.J. Cherryh's Foreigner series and means "a system under stress, needing adjustment.)

ğŸ’¾ I started in software back in the 80s with BASIC and have dabled in many languages, but mastered none. 

ğŸ“† Not being happy with most life help apps and utlities (planners, to-do lists, etc.) Iâ€™m workong on in creating such life helps apps that actually work the way my life does. 

ğŸ“« Best way to reach me is via email: haronniin [at] proton [dot] me
